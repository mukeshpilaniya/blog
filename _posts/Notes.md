## Amazone behaviour questions
1. Tell me a time you took time in an area out of your responsibility? What resulted of it?
2. Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tough or critical feedback and what you did in response?
3. Tell me a time that you were able to deliver on a tight deadline and what sacrifices did you make to do?
4. Tell me a time that you solved a complex problem with a simple solution?
5. Tell me the hardest bug you had to deal with and how you solved it and what impact it had?
6. Tell me a time you got really stuck and had a remove a serious block and what result it had?

## Amazone 
    5 stages
- 1 online assisments
#### onsite stage 4 interview (understand first)
- 1 DS first round (choosing correct data structure)
    - select and use ds and algo for the given problems
    - All the topics arrays, strings, linkedlist, stacks, queue, trees, graphs(BFS, DFS), hashmap, searching and sorting, sliding window problems, DP
- 2 problem solving second round (Implementing correct data structure)
    Implement and make the soluction work
    - list down all the solution (go for solution)
    - write clean code(best way to write code)
    - handle null and edge cases
    - time and space complexity
    - modularity
- hiring manager round
    - behaviour question, earn trust
    - client (vp, manager)
    - negative notes, positive notes -->Impactful your contribution
    - how Impactful my contribution is on organistion -->AWS cloud features
    - costumer requirements
    - explain your contribution which is highly impacted
- leadership round (bar raiser)
    - deliver the best
    - work on the solution
    - modular code, clean code, maintainable code
    - amazone previous question(gfg, refacyoring guru)


## Golang interview questions
- channel
- goroutine
- goroutine vs thread
- concurrency pattern
- testing in go


## Kafka and Redis arch


## Nosql vs SQL database

## RabbitMQ vs Kafka messaging 

|  RabbitMQ    |  Kafka |
| :---          | :--- |
| RabbitMQ is best for transactional data, such as order formation and placement, and user requests. Kafka works best with operational data like process operations, auditing and logging statistics, and system activity | Kafka is best used for streaming from A to B without resorting to complex routing, but with maximum throughput. Itâ€™s also ideal for event sourcing, stream processing, and carrying out modeling changes to a system as a sequence of events. Kafka is also suitable for processing data in multi-stage pipelines |
| 4k-10k message per second | 1 million message per second |
|transactional data types | operational data types |
| RabbitMQ sends messages to users. These messages are removed from the queue once they are processed and acknowledged | Kafka is a log. It uses continuous messages, which stay in the queue until the retention time expires.|
| Complex Routing, Legacy Applications |Tracking High-throughput Activity , Stream Processing, Event Sourcing, Log aggregation|
