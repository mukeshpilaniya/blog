## RabbitMQ vs Kafka messaging 

|  RabbitMQ    |  Kafka |
| :---          | :--- |
| RabbitMQ is best for transactional data, such as order formation and placement, and user requests. Kafka works best with operational data like process operations, auditing and logging statistics, and system activity | Kafka is best used for streaming from A to B without resorting to complex routing, but with maximum throughput. Itâ€™s also ideal for event sourcing, stream processing, and carrying out modeling changes to a system as a sequence of events. Kafka is also suitable for processing data in multi-stage pipelines |
| 4k-10k message per second | 1 million message per second |
|transactional data types | operational data types |
| RabbitMQ sends messages to users. These messages are removed from the queue once they are processed and acknowledged | Kafka is a log. It uses continuous messages, which stay in the queue until the retention time expires.|
| Complex Routing, Legacy Applications |Tracking High-throughput Activity , Stream Processing, Event Sourcing, Log aggregation|
