Algorithms-
1. Token Bucket
2. leaky Bucket 
    Itâ€™s also easy to implement on a single server or load balancer and is memory efficient for each user, given the limited queue size.
    adv- traffic is smooth 
3. fixed window counter
    disadv- traffic is not smooth 
4. sliding logs 
5. sliding window countermy
